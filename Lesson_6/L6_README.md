# The Airlines delay dataset contains flight data for the United States for Jan 2020

## The dataset was downloaded from Kaggle is saved in the datasets directory

## A clean version of the dataset is saved under Lesson 6 as "cleaned_Jan2020_airline_delay.csv"

This was a very useful dataset as it allowed a few columns to be created, some cleaning was required and there are some nice patterns to explore in the dataset.

The next steps would be to run some multi-dimensional analysis on top of what has been found in the opening exploratory analysis.

1. clear pattern of delays based on time buckets

2. clear patterns with airlines and airports on delays

3. No real evidence of delay pattern based on the flight distance in this dataset.


Some of the pre-bucketed data not accurate so as the alignment of departure time to the departure time buckets. The time bucket which I created seems very useful.

The merging of airport names to the dataset was not perfect but only affected less than 5 percent of the dataset. For the airport based analysis, I excluded this from the analysis.
