    "Statistics is one of the most widely used areas of mathematics. It helps us mere mortals collect, describe, and make inferences about natural and unnatural phenomena using data. It allows us to approximate answers to questions that were thought to be impossible to answer. In addition, a large number of scientific advancements have used this area of mathematics to quantify, test, validate, and improve our answers to problems with a wide range of complexities. For example, Albert Einstein and his groundbreaking theories of Special and General Relativity used statistics to approximate the movement of the sun in relation to that of other bodies of masses around our galaxy. To provide you with a more formal definition of statistics, the UCI Department of statistics has defined it as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"...the science concerned with developing and studying methods for collecting, analyzing, interpreting and presenting empirical data.\" Empirical here means based on observations and verifiable evidence as opposed to logic and deduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we know what \"_Statistics_\" is, let's define what \"_A Statistic_\" is. A Statistic is a piece of evidence or a fact obtained via a calculation performed on a sample of data. When you hear comments on the radio or read news statements that begin with, \"the average rugby player...\", \"the average Australian now days...\", etc., you are essentially being given \"_A Statistic_\". A fact compiled from a sample of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "__What is a Sample?__ A sample is a fraction of the population. For example, the students in this course, are a sample of the overall number of students in Australia. In this case, the number of students in Australia would be considered the total population of students, and the students of this course the sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "__What is the Population?__ The population is a set of data with some similarity, and it is the whole from where a sample is drawn from. Think about a cake sliced into pieces, the full cake is the population and a slice of it is the sample. Mickey can show us a good representation of this example.\n",
    "\n",
    "![cake](https://media.giphy.com/media/9u8GF7MuhdvS8/giphy.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "Going back to the example above, all students in Australia would be the population and the defining characteristic of this population is that they are all active students. If we needed, for example, the address of every one of these students but were unable to get 10 of them, we would call the set of students belonging to that characteristic, the address, a sample as it is a fraction of the full set. Another way to put it would be `Population - 10 = Sample`.\n",

    "- We can learn from information.\n",
    "- Draw conclusions based on evidence.\n",
    "- Simulate the real world.\n",
    "- Mine massive amounts of data.\n",

He found a surprisingly large positive correlation between the chocolate consumption of a country and the amount Nobel Laureates that same country has produced. See below.\n",

    "It is very important to have a project or idea you wish to explore before moving onto the data collection part. The reason behind this is that once you have context on what you would like to analyse, you will be able to search for that information more efficiently. For example, if you need to study the profitability of a movie theatre in a given year, you would need data about sale and airing times for the movies shown within your specific timeframe. If you would like to evaluate peoples' sentiment towards a political candidate on social media, you would need social media data and might benefit from looking in Twitter first.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether you have a question to answer or not, collecting data becomes the most important piece of the statistics puzzle. Especially because after all, without anything to analyse, we would be left with theoretical work only. Which is very important but also relies on proving such theories with real examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Collecting data can be as easy as clicking a button and downloading a table full of content that can be opened in excel (structured data), or as difficult as crawling over many websites and getting (unstructured) data to then formating it into a more usable structure. Here are two examples of how we encounter data:\n",

    "\n",
    "Notice that in the example above, the structured data resembles what we are used to seeing when we use or think of data. On the other hand, we might not be used to thinking that recipes from a restaurant, emails, poems, social media posts, all qualify as data. The most notable differences being the immediate usability of it and the unclear picture as to how to set it into a structured format.\n",
    "\n",
    "As analysts we can collect data through surveys, purchasing history (these are often stored automatically into a database like SQL or Microsoft Access), by tracking visits to a website, and many more. The information we get in a dataset, the data in its variables (or in excel lingo, the columns), is often represented in one of two ways: as categorical and quantitative information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Categorical data represent groups or specific characteristics of the data. For example, a column called gender that contains whether a survey participant was a male, female, or other, will count as a categorical variable. This type of classification, gender, counts as a specific type of categorical data called nominal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nominal data is the type of data that can be classified into groups but with no particular order to them. In the example of gender, we cannot say that female is greater than male or vice-versa. This takes us to our next type of categorical data, ordinal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordinal data are the type of data where order matters. Imagine you have a dataset with formula one drivers in the rows and all of the characteristics regarding their professional careers in the columns. If we were to have a variable for every race in which they competed, plus their placement within each race, keeping the order in which they crossed the finish line would be crucial for our dataset to be meaningful. Especially since first has a higher value than second, and of course, last. Another example of ordinal data is the temperature of a meal ordered at a restaurant. If we order a stake medium-well, we would expect to get the stake at a temperature within that range. In this scenario, order from hot to cold matters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantitative data, on the other hand, represents numerical data that can be quantified, summarized, averaged, and visualized, usually in more ways than categorical data can. Quantitative data can be income, revenue, stock prices, miles, weight, and height, and many more. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to notice that categorical data, whether nominal or ordinal, can still be collected in a numerical format without it being considered quantitative. Say we collect data for the level of spiciness of different meals at a restaurant and assign these values the numbers 3 for hot, 2 for warm, and 1 for cold, they would still be considered categorical data even though it would now be represented by a numerical value. One reason being that the quantities of this variable are finite.\n",

    "**Source:** https://www.karmelsoft.com/\n",
    "\n",
    "When we collect data specifically for statistical purposes we want to gain knowledge or learn about something that is important to us. There are two ways in which statistics concerns itself when it comes to data collection, and those are through observation and experimentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "An important point to keep in mind is that, although we have an idea of what the population we're interested in might look like or what the magnitude of it might be, we would never collect enough data to make a 100% prediction based on it. With that said though, there are many sampling methods that do allow us to get pretty close to our desired outcome. Let's first define observational and experimental studies.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sample Study:** a study where we try to estimate the true value of a parameter based on a sample of the real population. A parameter in this case would be a piece of information such as the mean, median, and mode in a sample regarding our question of interest. If you would like to know how many people per country, on average believe in global warming, asking everyone in the planet would be impossible. But by asking a random sample of people from each country, we could approximate the true average.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Observational Study:** In these kinds of studies, we are interested in a particular subsection of the population and we would like to determine what causes what without intervening with the sample being studied. For example, say we want to study the relatioship between smoking and drinking and we whether one causes the other or vice-versa. We would observe people in their natural environment and collect data about what happens when these actions take place.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also need to be cautious when upon first inspection all of our assumptions seem to match. A high correlation between both, smoking and drinking does not mean that one causes the other. It could be that there is a **confounding variable** behind the scenes controling the outcomes. For example, drinking and smoking could be due to being in a circle of friends where everyone smokes. It could also be a habbit triggered by the cue, \"out with friends socialising.\" Confounding variables, or for that matter, the real causes of a phenomena, are often hard to pick appart but not impossible.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Experimental:** Experiments are the toughest to due but are also the ones that can get you the cosest to causality. With experiments we are in search of what causes what and even go to great lenghts to pick random sample of people, then assign them to random groups, and induce the variable of interest to half of that sample and a placebo to the other. These two groups are also called, control and treatment group. If the size of the difference between the two groups is large or significant enough once the experiment ends, it can be possible to determine causation."

    "Descriptive Statistics is the process of describing and presenting your data. This is usually done through tables, visualisations and written descriptions of data. For example, if you conduct a survey to find out how much people like a particular brand, you will want to report the number of people that took the survey (the count), the average, minimum, and maximum age or even the median income of every respondant. With these data alone, we could move onto to making more informed and important decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous survey example, every survey taker would be a row, and every question in that survey would form the columns (see table below). Income, age, and favourite brand, would all represent different arrays or vectors of information in a two-dimensional matrix or dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "|    Name   |   Income  |  Age  | Favourite Brand |\n",
    "|-----------|-----------|-------|-----------------|\n",

    "|  Nicholas |   61,000  |   36  |   Adiddas       |\n",
    "\n",
    "Every one of these arrays can represent a categrorical or quantitative variable. Since data are often messy and even unstructured, we might also find other data structures, or free text (long strings) as the elements of a table like the one above. For the most part though, we will focus on the two types of variables we will often see, quantitative and categorical variables to describe our dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Descriptive statistics are often shown through tables and visualisations. For example, imagine you'd like to know the average life expectancy of people at age 60 in a specific group of countries. That visualisation would look like the one below.\n",

    "__So what should we look for when we want to describe data?__ We want to look for information that gives us facts about the data, such as the most common value of a set of characteristics, how far is a given value in variable from the average value of that same variable (e.g. how far is the age of a teacher selected at random from the average age of all teachers in Sydney). These two kinds of values, the average of a set and the variability of each value in a set, are part of what is known as measures of central tendency and measures of variability, respectively.\n",

    "__Measures of Central tendency__, also classified as summary statistics, are calculations that help us describe any data point in our dataset in relation to the most common values. The most common determinants of central tendency are the mean, median, and mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Measures of Variability__ tell us how spread-out our data is. Think about this as how much variation there is, whether up or down, in the income of your closest friends to that of the income of the average Australian. That distance from the income of your friends to the most common income (the average of all) gives us insights as to how much income variability there is in the entire population of Australia. In this instance, your friends would be consider a sample of the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common measures of variability are the range, variance and standard deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How do we describe categories and quantities?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Categorical variables can be shown using frequency tables and visualisations where each category of the variable is given a number representing the number of times that category was found in the dataset. For example, a question in a survey containing answer choices ranging from Strongly Agree to Strongly Disagree will have 5 categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantitative variables, on the other hand, can be summarised with averages, percentiles, scatterplots, etc., and tend to provide different perspectives and insights than qualitative variables.\n",
    "\n",
